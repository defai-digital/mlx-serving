Let's break it down in simple terms:\n\n**Cryptography** is like a secret code that helps keep information safe.\n\nImagine you want to send a secret message to a friend, but you don’t want anyone else to read it. So, you **lock** the message with a special key — only your friend has the matching key to unlock and read it.\n\nThat’s what cryptography does:\n- **Encrypt** = Lock the message (turn it into secret code).\n- **Decrypt**"
