Let's break it down in simple terms:\n\n**Cryptography** is like a secret code that helps keep information safe.\n\nImagine you want to send a secret message to your friend, but you don’t want anyone else to read it. Cryptography is the method you use to turn your message into something that looks like nonsense to anyone who isn’t supposed to see it.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n1. **You write a message** – say, \"Meet me at 5.\"\n"

It's called \"cloud\" because the data and services are stored in a network of remote servers accessed over the internet. This way, you can access your files and programs from any device with an internet connection, and you don't need to worry about maintaining the physical hardware or software.
