Here's a simple explanation of **cryptography**:\n\nCryptography is like a secret code that helps keep information safe.\n\nImagine you want to send a message to a friend, but you don’t want anyone else to read it. So, you write your message in a special way (like changing letters or using a secret key) so only your friend— who knows how to \"decode\" it—can understand it.\n\nThat’s what cryptography does:\n\n- It **encrypts** (locks"

Instead of sending every piece of video data to a distant server to decide if someone is moving, edge computing lets the device make that decision right there, on the spot.
